# iOS Conveniences
Some protocols and extensions I've built up over time that I will use in most of my Swift projects and want to be able to bring in as a submodule.

>Note: At present, this repo is just raw Swift files and does not inclue an Xcode project. As such, it will not compile. Additionally, some of the extensions depend on 3rd party libraries (e.g. ReactiveSwift), so a Carthage "Cartfile" is included for reference.)
